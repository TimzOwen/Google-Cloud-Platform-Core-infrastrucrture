    Storage
    Big data 
    Machine Learning 

### Cloud Computing

    computing resources on demand and self service
    storage  and network you need
    Access resources from anywhere you want
    resources are elastic
    Measured service

## GCP regions and ZONEs

Zone --> deployment ares for Google cloud resources


Cloud also offers APIs intergrations from other open source providers

#### Security for GCP and Data 

Operational Security -->Intrusion detection & software and employees

internet communication --> Denial of service attack protection

Storage service-->Encryption at rest

User identitiy-->Central identity service U2F (attacker to systems and servers)

Service deployments-->Encryption of interservice communication

Hardware infrastructure--> premise security & secure boot stack from data loss



Quotas:
    prevent againest overuser of resoures

    Allocation quotas

    Rate quotas

Access management in the cloud

    workloads in GCP:
    
    uses Identity and Access Manager (IAM)

    APIs

    web-based Console

    SDK 

    commandline

    Mobile Apps

#### GCP REsource Hierachy

Grouped arccoding to the organization's structure

provide resources allocations and isolations

organizaition nde:
    
    The root node fro GCP resources

    File organization also affects user access and modification
